  ## Description

  README generator is a program to help junior developers or those just starting their coding journey, to be able to create and write a quality README.md.  This program has several prompted questions to help those who are unsure of what to wrtie in their README doc.  It was built with javascript, node, markdown and the inquirer package on npm.  Future renditions of this program will include more list options, such as choosing which technologies were used for your project.
